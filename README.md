This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that helps you do tracking in notes [over dates](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/Questions.md) and represent the collected data comprehensively. 

[Here](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/Examples.md) is a simplified table of examples showing what you can track.

## Usage
1. Have some targets you want to track in daily notes. Take a look at [Target Evaluation](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/TargetEvaluation.md) for what you can track and how targets are evaluated as numbers.
2. Add a new note for displaying the tracker.
3. Add tracker code blocks manually or using commands. See [Commands](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/Commands.md) for more detail.
4. Switch the document view mode to 'Preview', then the code block will get rendered.
