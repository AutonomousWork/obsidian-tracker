This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that helps you do tracking in notes and represent the collected data comprehensively. 

[Here](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/Examples.md) is a simplified table of examples showing what you can track.

## What's New
Version 1.7.0
- Add a new output type 'month', rendering a month view for a given dataset ([examples](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/examples/TestCalendar.md))

## Usage
1. Have some targets you want to track in daily notes.
2. Add a new note for displaying the tracker.
3. Add tracker code blocks manually or using [commands](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/Commands.md).
4. Switch the document view mode to 'Preview', then the code block will get rendered.
