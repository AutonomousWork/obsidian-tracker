![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/master/docs/images/screenshot_v1.6.png" width="800">

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that helps you do tracking in notes [over dates](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/Questions.md) and represent the collected data comprehensively. 

[Here](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/Examples.md) is a simplified table of examples showing what you can track.

## What's New
Version 1.6.0
1. Add a new input type 'fileMeta', getting meta data from a file ([examples](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/examples/Test%20FileMeta.md))
2. Add a new output type 'bullet', rendering a bullet chart ([examples](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/examples/TestBullet.md))
3. Accept tracking time values ([examples](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/examples/TestTimeValues.md))
4. Allow tracking nested values from front matter
5. Allow using dataset with date values as xDataset ([examples](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/examples/TestXDataset.md))
6. Add more template variables ([examples](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/examples/TestXDataset.md))
7. Allow parsing date in wiki brackets

## Usage
1. Have some targets you want to track in daily notes. Take a look at [Target Evaluation](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/TargetEvaluation.md) for what you can track and how targets are evaluated as numbers.
2. Add a new note for displaying the tracker.
3. Add tracker code blocks manually or using commands. See [Commands](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/Commands.md) for more details.
4. Switch the document view mode to 'Preview', then the code block will get rendered.
