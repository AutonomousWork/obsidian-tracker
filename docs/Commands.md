# Commands 
To smooth the process of making trackers, we provide two commands, "Add Line Chart Tracker" and "Add Summary Tracker; Type Ctrl/Cmd+P to activate the command palette, then type "Tracker" to search it.

After a command is selected, a code block will be added to the next line below your cursor. The added code block will contain the most frequently used keys. To see the complete list of input parameters and explanations, check [this document](InputParameters.md).

Now replace the fields for your case and start tracking.
