# Commands Help Add Tracker Code Block
To smooth the process of making trackers, we provide two commands, "Add Line Chart Tracker" and "Add Summary Tracker". Simply type Ctrl/Cmd+P to activate the command palette, then type "Tracker" to get the commands.

After picking a command, a tracker code block of your choice will be added to the next line below your cursor, including all keys and default values. Now it's your call to fill in data for searching and rendering.

Except for 'searchType' and 'searchTarget', Key-value pairs with default values can be removed for a conciseÂ code block.
